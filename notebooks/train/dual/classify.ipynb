    "### I have a dataset of neural activities with small sample size and high number of neurons. I want to find the subspaces encoding different task conditions: the stimuli A vs B and the choice of the animal Lick/ no Lick. How can I proceed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s one way to approach the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Define your goals clearly. You want to extract subspaces (or latent\n",
    "    low‐dimensional representations) that are associated with (a) the\n",
    "    stimulus (A vs. B) and (b) the behavioral choice (Lick vs. no Lick).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Preprocess the data. Because you have many neurons relative to the\n",
    "    number of trials, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    " • Normalizing the firing rates (or z‐scaling) per neuron.  • Removing\n",
    "(or regressing out) any common baseline activity if needed.  • Possibly\n",
    "averaging across similar trials to improve the signal/noise ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Dimensionality reduction as a first step. The high dimensionality\n",
    "    (many neurons) and small sample size can lead to overfitting so a\n",
    "    dimensionality reduction method is advisable:\n",
    "\n",
    " • Start with a method like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to\n",
    "capture the major sources of variance. Although PCA itself is “blind” to\n",
    "task variables, it can reduce noise and reduce dimensions from the\n",
    "many-neuron space to a few dozen “components.”\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Use demixed analysis techniques. To tease apart the contributions of\n",
    "    stimulus and choice, consider “demixed” methods such as demixed\n",
    "    Principal Component Analysis (dPCA). dPCA is specifically designed\n",
    "    for neural data where different task parameters (e.g., stimulus\n",
    "    identity, decision/choice) are intermingled in the population\n",
    "    activity. It finds projections that maximize explained variance\n",
    "    while “demixing” the variance attributable to different task\n",
    "    parameters. Steps involve:\n",
    "\n",
    " • Labeling each trial according to its task conditions (stimulus A vs.\n",
    "B, and Lick vs. no Lick).  • Running dPCA on your trial data to obtain\n",
    "components that are predominantly tuned to stimulus, mostly to choice,\n",
    "and possibly to interaction effects.  • Inspecting the resulting\n",
    "components/subspaces to see if they align with your expectations (e.g.,\n",
    "variance explained, separation between conditions).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Alternative/Complementary methods:\n",
    "\n",
    " • Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) or logistic regression with\n",
    "regularization: These methods can help in finding directions that best\n",
    "discriminate between conditions (A vs. B, Lick vs. no Lick). However,\n",
    "because of the small sample size, you’d need to use regularization\n",
    "(L1/L2) or even shrinkage methods.  • Targeted dimensionality reduction\n",
    "procedures, where you first build a classifier (again taking care with\n",
    "regularization and cross-validation) and then inspect the classifier\n",
    "weights to see which neurons or neural directions are most informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Cross-validation and robustness. Given the small sample size you\n",
    "    mentioned, it’s critical to:\n",
    "\n",
    " • Use cross-validation (or bootstrapping) to ensure that the identified\n",
    "subspaces generalize.  • Possibly use permutation testing to establish\n",
    "the significance of the separations (i.e., that the subspace dimensions\n",
    "are not just overfitting noise).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Interpret the subspaces. Once you have obtained the subspaces:\n",
    "\n",
    " • Visualize the projections. For example, plot the trials in the\n",
    "low-dimensional space and see if the stimulus and choice conditions\n",
    "segregate.  • Quantify how much of the variance (and specifically,\n",
    "task-related variance) is captured in each subspace.  • Compare these\n",
    "findings to your theoretical expectations about how the encoding might\n",
    "be organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a promising pipeline is to first apply PCA (or another\n",
    "noise-reduction method) and then employ a demixed analysis like dPCA,\n",
    "which will allow you to separate the contributions from the stimulus and\n",
    "the choice despite having a high-dimensional but limited-sample dataset.\n",
    "This approach has been successfully applied in many neural data analyses\n",
    "(see e.g., Kobak et al.’s work on dPCA).\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these methods with careful cross-validation and\n",
    "regularization strategies to guard against overfitting, you should be\n",
    "able to extract meaningful subspaces corresponding to the different task\n",
    "conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How would you preprocess the data? the data is fluorescence signals from neurons in the shape (n<sub>samples</sub>, n<sub>neurons</sub>, n<sub>time</sub>).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a step-by-step guide on how you might preprocess your\n",
    "fluorescence signal data with shape (n<sub>samples</sub>,\n",
    "n<sub>neurons</sub>, n<sub>time</sub>):\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Align Trials and Define Epochs:\n",
    "\n",
    " • Ensure that your time axis is correctly aligned to relevant events\n",
    "(e.g., stimulus onset, response, etc.).  • Define baseline, stimulus,\n",
    "and response epochs so you can later compute baseline corrections.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Baseline Correction (dF/F Calculation):\n",
    "\n",
    " • For each trial and each neuron, identify a baseline period (often a\n",
    "time window before stimulus onset).  • Compute the baseline fluorescence\n",
    "(F₀), for example by taking the average fluorescence over the baseline\n",
    "period.  • Calculate the relative change in fluorescence as dF/F:\n",
    "   dF/F = (F - F₀) / F₀   This normalization minimizes differences due\n",
    "to varying absolute fluorescence levels across neurons and trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Denoising and Smoothing:\n",
    "\n",
    " • Fluorescence signals tend to be noisy. Apply a temporal filter (e.g.,\n",
    "a low-pass filter or a moving average) to smooth the signals.  •\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use more advanced denoising algorithms (e.g.,\n",
    "wavelet denoising or PCA-based denoising) if the noise is substantial.\n",
    " • Be cautious—not to oversmooth—to preserve the temporal dynamics\n",
    "critical for task-related activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Normalization Across Trials and Neurons:\n",
    "\n",
    " • After computing dF/F, it can be useful to standardize the data. You\n",
    "might z-score the data for each neuron across all time points and\n",
    "trials: subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation.  • This\n",
    "step helps when neurons have vastly different dynamic ranges, ensuring\n",
    "that subsequent analyses (like PCA or dPCA) are not dominated by neurons\n",
    "with inherently larger fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you mean by across all time points and trials?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say \"across all time points and trials,\" we mean that for each\n",
    "neuron you treat all of its data—over every trial and every time step—as\n",
    "one pool of observations when calculating its mean and standard\n",
    "deviation for normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you have a neuron with a data array that has\n",
    "dimensions corresponding to trials and time (after any initial\n",
    "processing like dF/F). You would concatenate all of these values (or\n",
    "equivalently, compute statistics over the entire (n<sub>samples</sub> ×\n",
    "n<sub>time</sub>) array for that neuron) to get a single mean value and\n",
    "standard deviation. Then, for each actual time point in each trial, you\n",
    "subtract that mean and divide by that standard deviation. This results\n",
    "in a z-scored time course for that neuron which has a mean of 0 and a\n",
    "standard deviation of 1 based on all available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalizing in this way helps ensure that neurons with inherently\n",
    "different scales or levels of variability contribute comparably during\n",
    "later analyses like PCA or dPCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### But if a neuron is stimulus selectivve then it will bias its mean activity no ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, using all time points to compute the mean can incorporate\n",
    "stimulus-evoked changes, which might bias the normalization if the\n",
    "response magnitude is high. This happens because the normalization then\n",
    "reflects not just the baseline variability but also the task-related\n",
    "modulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to avoid this is to compute the baseline mean and standard\n",
    "deviation using a time window when the stimulus is absent (e.g.,\n",
    "pre-stimulus period). Then, you can normalize each trial using these\n",
    "baseline statistics so that the effect of the stimulus doesn't skew the\n",
    "overall normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### what is best?\n",
    "\n",
    "It depends on your goals, but a baseline normalization (using a\n",
    "pre-stimulus time window to compute mean and standard deviation) is\n",
    "often preferred. This avoids biasing the normalization with\n",
    "stimulus-evoked activity and better highlights changes relative to a\n",
    "known “resting” state. However, if you're interested in global activity\n",
    "patterns across the whole trial, normalizing over all time points may be\n",
    "acceptable. In practice, baseline normalization is usually considered\n",
    "best for isolating task-evoked responses from the intrinsic variability\n",
    "of each neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\***\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Artifact Removal:\n",
    "\n",
    " • Inspect the data for any trials or neurons with obvious artifacts\n",
    "(e.g., sudden jumps or drops in signal not related to neural activity).\n",
    " • Consider excluding or correcting these artifacts, as they can bias\n",
    "downstream dimensionality reduction or decoding analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Trial Averaging (if applicable):\n",
    "\n",
    " • If your sample size is extremely limited and if it’s appropriate to\n",
    "your experimental design, you might average across trials of the same\n",
    "condition to improve your signal-to-noise ratio.  • However, be careful\n",
    "as averaging can mask trial-to-trial variability you might later find\n",
    "informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Optional: Additional Filtering or Feature Extraction:\n",
    "\n",
    " • You might perform additional filtering (e.g., detrending if there is\n",
    "drift) or extract features (like peak amplitudes, onset latencies, etc.)\n",
    "if these features are useful for your analysis.  • Some analyses benefit\n",
    "from reducing data dimensionality at this stage (e.g., by computing\n",
    "summary statistics within defined time windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Verification:\n",
    "\n",
    " • Visualize a few single-trial traces and the averaged responses to\n",
    "ensure that the preprocessing steps (dF/F and smoothing) have resulted\n",
    "in meaningful signals.  • Check that the fluctuations correspond to your\n",
    "expected neural events or task-related responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following these steps should prepare your fluorescence signal data for\n",
    "further dimensionality reduction and subspace analysis (e.g., PCA, dPCA,\n",
    "or LDA) aimed at isolating the neural encoding of the task conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Are you sure that I should use PCA first?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not absolutely mandatory to apply PCA first, but there are reasons\n",
    "why doing so is often beneficial—especially in your situation with many\n",
    "neurons and relatively few experimental trials. Here are a few points to\n",
    "consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Noise reduction and regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    " • PCA helps you reduce the dimensionality by concentrating on the\n",
    "directions with the highest variance.  • With a high number of neurons\n",
    "and limited data, you risk overfitting any method you apply. A PCA-based\n",
    "reduction can filter out noise, improving the signal-to-noise ratio for\n",
    "subsequent analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Computational simplicity:\n",
    "\n",
    " • Reducing the dimensionality before applying a method like demixed PCA\n",
    "(dPCA) or LDA can lower computational costs and simplify the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Preservation of task-relevant variance:\n",
    "\n",
    " • One concern is that if you remove too many dimensions with PCA, you\n",
    "might discard variance that carries information about your task\n",
    "conditions (stimulus A vs. B or lick vs. no lick).  • To mitigate this,\n",
    "you can choose the number of PCA components carefully—for example, by\n",
    "cross-validating the selection or examining the cumulative variance\n",
    "explained. If you see that most task-related variance is retained, then\n",
    "it’s a justified step.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Alternative approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    " • There are methods that directly incorporate task labels (like dPCA)\n",
    "or supervised approaches (like regularized LDA) that can potentially\n",
    "work without the preliminary PCA step. However, these methods can also\n",
    "benefit from an initial dimensionality reduction to mitigate\n",
    "overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while you’re not forced to use PCA as a first step, it is a\n",
    "common and practical method in neuroscience research to handle the curse\n",
    "of dimensionality and small sample sizes, provided you’re cautious with\n",
    "how much variance you throw away. If you decide not to use it, or if\n",
    "you’re worried about losing task-relevant information, you might instead\n",
    "apply a method like dPCA directly with appropriate regularization and\n",
    "cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the subspaces you extract.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\***\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, you can use bootstrapping—but there are some nuances to consider\n",
    "given your setting of high-dimensional neural data with a relatively\n",
    "small sample size. Here’s a breakdown of how you might proceed and some\n",
    "caveats:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Bootstrapping for Estimation and Confidence Intervals:\n",
    "\n",
    "  • You can resample your trials (or task conditions) with replacement\n",
    "and re-run dPCA on each sample. This allows you to estimate the\n",
    "variability (or confidence intervals) of the extracted components and\n",
    "subspaces.   • Doing so can help you gauge which components are robust\n",
    "versus those that may be artifacts of your limited dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Bootstrapping for Stability Assessment:\n",
    "\n",
    "  • Beyond confidence intervals, bootstrapping can help check the\n",
    "stability of the stimulus-encoding subspaces. If, across many\n",
    "bootstrapped samples, the same subspaces appear, then you may have\n",
    "greater confidence in your findings.   • Conversely, if the estimated\n",
    "subspaces vary widely, it may be a sign of overfitting or that your data\n",
    "are too noisy for the current method.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "  • Small Sample Size: Bootstrapping works best when the resampled\n",
    "distributions are representative of the true underlying distribution;\n",
    "with very few samples, each bootstrap replicate might be highly\n",
    "variable. This can lead to uncertainty in your estimates.   •\n",
    "Overfitting: High-dimensional data (many neurons) might lead to\n",
    "overfitting in each bootstrap sample. Regularizing your dPCA solution\n",
    "(or the preprocessing steps) might help mitigate this issue.   •\n",
    "Alternative Methods: Given the sample size issue, you might also\n",
    "consider other dimensionality reduction techniques that are robust in\n",
    "high dimensions, such as regularized methods, factor analysis, or sparse\n",
    "coding approaches. Bayesian latent variable models can also incorporate\n",
    "prior information that might help with small sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Practical Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "  • Resampling: Decide whether to bootstrap across trials, neurons, or\n",
    "both. Often, trials are the natural resampling unit if the neurons are\n",
    "recorded simultaneously.   • Cross-Validation: Combine bootstrapping\n",
    "with cross-validation to help prevent overfitting. For instance, use\n",
    "bootstrapped samples to determine the optimal model complexity (number\n",
    "of dPCA components) on a training set, then validate on held-out data.\n",
    "  • Report Uncertainty: Use the bootstrapped estimates to report the\n",
    "variability of the projections. This can provide more insight into which\n",
    "dimensions are statistically robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, bootstrapping is a viable tool in your analysis toolbox,\n",
    "both for estimating the stability of your dPCA results and for assessing\n",
    "uncertainty in your estimated stimulus-encoding subspaces. Just ensure\n",
    "that you’re careful in interpreting the results, particularly given the\n",
    "limitations imposed by small sample sizes in a high-dimensional setting.\n",
