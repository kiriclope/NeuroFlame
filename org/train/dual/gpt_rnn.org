*** I am training a RNN. THe RNN has a static random connectivity and an additional low rank part. How can I train the net so that the low rank part stays weak in comparison to the random part

One way to ensure that the low‐rank part of your recurrent weight matrix remains “weak” compared to the static random part is to regularize or scale its contribution during training. Here are a few strategies you can use:

1. Keep the random part fixed and train only the low‐rank component. By not altering the static random connectivity, you guarantee that all adaptation comes from the low‐rank update—and then you can explicitly control its magnitude.

2. Scale the low‐rank weights by a small constant factor. When you parameterize the weight matrix as the sum of a random matrix W_random and a low‐rank matrix W_lowrank, you might write:
  W = W_random + α W_lowrank
Choosing α ≪ 1 ensures that even if W_lowrank changes during training, its overall contribution remains scaled down relative to the random part.

3. Apply regularization specifically on the low-rank component. You can add an L2 (or even L1) penalty term to your loss that targets only the low-rank parameters. That way, during gradient descent, you penalize large deviations in the low-rank matrix and keep its effective magnitude small relative to the fixed random connectivity.

4. Use gradient scaling or clipping. Another approach is to scale down the gradients of the low-rank parameters before applying the update so that even if the raw gradients are large, the effective update is small. This prevents the low-rank part from “taking over” too quickly.

5. Impose explicit constraints or projection steps. For instance, if you are parameterizing W_lowrank as an outer product U·Vᵀ, you might project U and/or V onto balls of a fixed radius after each update. This can enforce a hard constraint on the norm of the low-rank part.

In summary, by either pre-scaling, regularizing, or explicitly constraining the low-rank part of your network’s weights, you can ensure that the adaptive (or trained) low-rank contributions remain subdued relative to the static random part. Choose the strategy (or combination of strategies) that best fits your training dynamics and desired behavior.

*** How would you apply regularization?

To regularize the low-rank part of your RNN, you can directly add a penalty term to your loss function that targets only the parameters corresponding to that component. Here are some detailed ways to do so:

1. L2 Regularization (Weight Decay):
 • Suppose your overall weight matrix is W = W_random + αW_lowrank, and you keep W_random fixed while training only W_lowrank (or its factors, if factorized as U and V). You can add an L2 penalty term to your loss function that penalizes the magnitude of W_lowrank. For example, if your original loss function is ℒ, you modify it as:
  Loss = ℒ + λ‖W_lowrank‖²
 Here, λ is a hyperparameter that determines how strongly you penalize large values in W_lowrank. Choosing a sufficiently large λ will force the low-rank parameters to remain small.

2. L1 Regularization:
 • If you prefer to encourage sparsity in W_lowrank, you can add an L1 penalty instead:
  Loss = ℒ + λ‖W_lowrank‖₁
 This encourages many of the parameters in the low-rank part to get pushed toward zero, keeping its overall contribution limited.

3. Regularization on Factorized Components:
 • When parameterizing your low-rank component as, say, W_lowrank = U·Vᵀ, you can regularize U and V individually:
  Loss = ℒ + λ_U‖U‖²_F + λ_V‖V‖²_F
 The hyperparameters λ_U and λ_V allow you to control the norms of U and V separately. You may set these to be relatively large so that the norms of U and V remain small, thereby limiting the overall size of W_lowrank.

4. Adaptive Regularization:
 • You can also consider making the regularization coefficient adaptive based on training dynamics. For instance, if you notice that the contribution of the low-rank part is becoming too strong relative to W_random, you might increase the regularization strength for that part in subsequent training iterations.

5. Implementation Considerations:
 • In most deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.), you can specify different parameter groups to apply different learning rates and weight decay values. By isolating the low-rank parameters into their own parameter group, you can assign them a larger weight decay (λ) compared to other parameters.
 • Keep in mind that choosing an appropriate regularization coefficient may require some candidate testing or using a validation set to ensure you're not over-penalizing the low-rank part and hindering the network's ability to learn the desired behavior.

By applying these regularization techniques, you essentially bias the training process to keep the magnitude of the low-rank updates small relative to the fixed random part, ensuring that your network retains the desired structural properties.

*** How would you implement this in torch

Below is an example of how you might implement a custom RNN cell in PyTorch that uses a fixed random connectivity matrix plus a trainable low‐rank component. In this example, the low‐rank part is parameterized via two factor matrices U and V (so that W_lowrank = U @ Vᵀ) with a scaling term. We then set up the optimizer to apply weight decay (L2 regularization) only to U and V.

        super(CustomRNNCell, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.alpha = alpha

        # Fixed static random connectivity (no gradients)
        # Initialize and immediately freeze it.
        W_random = torch.randn(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.register_buffer('W_random', W_random)  # stored as buffer, not trainable

        # Low-rank components: U and V such that W_lowrank = U @ V^T.
        self.U = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(hidden_size, low_rank_dim))
        self.V = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(hidden_size, low_rank_dim))

        # An input-to-hidden mapping.
        self.input2hidden = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)

    def forward(self, x, h_prev):

        # Combine the fixed random weights and the scaled low-rank component.
        # The scaling factor alpha keeps the low-rank part small compared to W_random.
        W = self.W_random + self.alpha * W_lowrank

        # Compute the recurrent update: combine the input transformation and recurrent state.
        # For example, use a tanh nonlinearity.
        h_new = torch.tanh(self.input2hidden(x) + torch.matmul(h_prev, W))
        return h_new

* Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Hyperparameters

        {'params': [model.U, model.V], 'weight_decay': weight_decay},
        {'params': model.input2hidden.parameters()}  # If there are others that might not need regularization.
    ], lr=learning_rate)

    h = torch.zeros(10, hidden_size)    # initial hidden state

    # A simple training loop demonstration.
    for epoch in range(5):

        h = model(x, h)
        # Suppose our target is to get zeros (just for demonstration):
        target = torch.zeros_like(h)
        loss = F.mse_loss(h, target)

Explanation

1. Fixed Random Component:
 • W_random is created as a tensor and then registered as a buffer (via register_buffer) so that it is part of the module but not updated during training.

2. Low-Rank Component:
 • Two parameters, U and V, represent the low-rank part. Their product gives W_lowrank. The overall weight matrix is W = W_random + α·W_lowrank.
 • The scaling factor α (set here to 0.1) keeps the low-rank contributions small relative to the fixed W_random.

3. Regularization:
 • We use the optimizer’s built-in weight decay to apply L2 regularization on U and V.
 • By placing U and V in a parameter group with a specified weight_decay value, we ensure that updates to these parameters are penalized. For parameters that should not be regularized (like input2hidden or any others), either omit weight_decay or set it to 0.
 • Alternatively, you could manually add the regularization term to your loss:
  loss = original_loss + λ/(torch.norm(model.U)*2 + torch.norm(model.V)*2)
 but using the optimizer’s parameter groups is more convenient and leverages built-in functionality.

4. Training Loop:
 • The training loop is a standard PyTorch loop: zero_grad, forward, compute loss, backward, optimizer.step().

This implementation shows one straightforward way to keep the low-rank part of your RNN small via L2-regularization applied directly to its parameters using PyTorch.

*** What should I use for weight_decay?

There isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer for the value of weight_decay—it’s a hyperparameter that typically needs to be tuned based on your model architecture, data, and specific training dynamics. However, here are some guidelines:

1. Start with a small value: For many RNN-based models, weight_decay values in the range of 1e-4 to 1e-3 often work well. You might consider starting with 1e-3 if you need the regularization to be strong, or 1e-4 if you want more relaxed regularization.

2. Consider the scale of the low-rank component: Since the low-rank parameters (U and V) are supposed to remain small relative to the fixed random part, you may want to err on the side of a stronger weight decay. If the magnitude of U and V tends to grow too much during training, a higher weight_decay might be necessary.

3. Monitor training and validation: Keep an eye on both training and validation losses. A too-high weight_decay might under-fit by forcing the parameters to be excessively small, while a too-low value might allow them to grow beyond what you intend.

4. Use grid search or other hyperparameter tuning methods: Experiment with a few different values (e.g., 1e-4, 5e-4, 1e-3, etc.) and validate their performance.

5. Compare with additional regularization techniques: Sometimes a combination of weight_decay along with manual scaling or gradient clipping (for the low-rank parameters) may yield better tuning control.

In summary, begin with a baseline (say 1e-3), and then adjust based on how the low-rank component behaves during training and what you observe on your validation set.

*** I would like the weights in W_low_rank to scale as 1/K

One straightforward way to ensure that the contribution from the low‑rank part scales as 1/K—where K is the rank (i.e., the dimensionality of your low‑rank factors)—is to explicitly multiply the low‑rank matrix by 1/K in its computation. For example, if you are representing your low‑rank component as an outer product of two matrices U (of size [N, K]) and V (of size [N, K]), you can compute it as

  W_lowrank = (1/K) * (U @ Vᵀ).

This explicitly scales the overall magnitude of the low‑rank part as 1/K, regardless of the dimensions of U and V.

Below is a modified version of our earlier PyTorch example that incorporates this scaling:

Code Example:
------------------------------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.nn.functional as F

class CustomRNNCell(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, low_rank_dim):
        super(CustomRNNCell, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.low_rank_dim = low_rank_dim  # K

        # Fixed static random connectivity (no gradients)
        W_random = torch.randn(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.register_buffer('W_random', W_random)

        # Low-rank components: U and V such that W_lowrank = U @ Vᵀ.
        self.U = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(hidden_size, low_rank_dim))
        self.V = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(hidden_size, low_rank_dim))

        # Input-to-hidden mapping.
        self.input2hidden = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)

    def forward(self, x, h_prev):
        # Compute the low-rank component and scale it by 1/K.
        # This ensures that W_lowrank scales as 1/K.
        W_lowrank = (1.0 / self.low_rank_dim) * (self.U @ self.V.t())

        # Combine the fixed random weights and the low-rank component.
        W = self.W_random + W_lowrank

        # Compute the recurrent update, e.g., using a tanh nonlinearity.
        h_new = torch.tanh(self.input2hidden(x) + torch.matmul(h_prev, W))
        return h_new

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Hyperparameters
    input_size = 20
    hidden_size = 50
    low_rank_dim = 5  # K value
    learning_rate = 0.001
    weight_decay = 1e-3  # Regularization strength for the low-rank parameters

    # Create the model.
    model = CustomRNNCell(input_size, hidden_size, low_rank_dim)

    # Create an optimizer that applies regularization (weight decay) on U and V.
    optimizer = optim.Adam([
        {'params': [model.U, model.V], 'weight_decay': weight_decay},
        {'params': model.input2hidden.parameters()}
    ], lr=learning_rate)

    # Dummy input and initial hidden state for demonstration.
    batch_size = 10
    x = torch.randn(batch_size, input_size)
    h = torch.zeros(batch_size, hidden_size)

    # Simple training loop for demonstration.
    for epoch in range(5):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        h = model(x, h)
        target = torch.zeros_like(h)  # Just for demonstration purposes.
        loss = F.mse_loss(h, target)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        print("Epoch:", epoch, "Loss:", loss.item())

------------------------------------------------------------
Explanation:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. In the forward() method, after computing W_lowrank as U @ Vᵀ, we multiply by (1.0 / self.low_rank_dim). This enforces that as the rank dimension (K) increases, the overall magnitude of the low-rank part scales as 1/K.

2. The fixed random weight matrix remains unchanged, and the overall recurrent weight matrix is computed as W = W_random + W_lowrank.

3. We still use the optimizer's built-in weight_decay option on U and V so that besides the scaling factor of 1/K, the optimizer discourages U and V from growing too large.

With this approach, you ensure that your low‑rank updates intrinsically have the desired scaling behavior.

*** Can I use regularization to maitain U and V at order/scale 1

Yes, you can use regularization—and even projection techniques—to help keep U and V at an order-of-magnitude around 1 during training. Here are a few strategies:

1. L2 Regularization (Weight Decay):
 • By adding L2 regularization on U and V to your loss function (or using the optimizer’s weight_decay for those parameters), you penalize large values in these matrices. Often, this encourages their norms to stay around O(1) rather than growing. You control the strength with a hyperparameter (λ) that you might need to tune.

2. Explicit Norm Constraint (Projection):
 • After each update, you can project U and/or V so that their norms reflect your desired scale. For example, suppose you want each parameter matrix’s Frobenius norm to be near 1; you can do:
  if norm(U) > threshold: U = U / norm(U)
 • This hard constraint forces the matrices to be rescaled after each update, maintaining a roughly constant scale.

3. Adaptive Regularization:
 • Sometimes it helps to monitor the norms of U and V during training. If you find that their norms are drifting, you can adaptively adjust the regularization strength (or even combine regularization with occasional re-normalization steps) to nudge them back to the desired scale.

In PyTorch, using weight_decay within your optimizer is straightforward and often sufficient if tuned correctly. Here’s a brief snippet that sets weight_decay for U and V:

------------------------------------------------------------
Example:
------------------------------------------------------------
optimizer = optim.Adam([
    {'params': [model.U, model.V], 'weight_decay': 1e-3},  # adjust 1e-3 as needed
    {'params': model.input2hidden.parameters()}
], lr=learning_rate)
------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to add an explicit norm projection after each optimizer step, you could do something like this in your training loop:

------------------------------------------------------------
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(x, h)
    loss = F.mse_loss(output, target)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    # Project U and V to maintain a specific norm (e.g., unit norm)
    with torch.no_grad():
        U_norm = model.U.norm(p='fro')
        V_norm = model.V.norm(p='fro')
        desired_norm = 1.0  # or any other value you consider “order 1”
        if U_norm > 0:
            model.U.mul_(desired_norm / U_norm)
        if V_norm > 0:
            model.V.mul_(desired_norm / V_norm)
------------------------------------------------------------

By applying either (or a combination) of these strategies, you can keep the matrices U and V from drifting to large values during training, thereby maintaining their scales close to 1. This in turn helps your low-rank update (scaled appropriately, for instance by 1/K if that’s what you prefer) to stay in the desired regime relative to the rest of your weights.

*** frobenius is norm 2

That's right—the Frobenius norm is essentially an L2 norm for matrices. In PyTorch, when calling tensor.norm(p='fro'), you compute the square root of the sum of the squares of all elements, which is equivalent to treating the matrix as a long vector and computing its L2 norm.

If your goal is to keep U and V at a consistent scale (say, unit norm under the Frobenius norm), then regularizing with weight decay penalizes the squared Frobenius norm (since weight decay applies an L2 penalty), or you can use explicit projection after the optimization step.

For example, using weight decay means that during optimization the loss gets an extra term proportional to U.norm(p='fro')² (and similarly for V). This pushes the optimizer to keep their magnitude small. Alternatively, if you want a hard constraint, you can project:

----------------------------------------------------------------
with torch.no_grad():
    desired_norm = 1.0  # Target scale
    U_norm = model.U.norm(p='fro')
    if U_norm > 0:
        model.U.mul_(desired_norm / U_norm)
    V_norm = model.V.norm(p='fro')
    if V_norm > 0:
        model.V.mul_(desired_norm / V_norm)
----------------------------------------------------------------

This projection forces each update to rescale U and V so that their Frobenius (L2) norm stays at 1.

Thus, whether you use weight decay (a soft regularization approach) or explicit projection (a hard constraint), you're effectively controlling the L2, or Frobenius, norm of U and V.

*** does this makes sure that the norm is not 0

The projection code only scales U or V if the norm is greater than zero. For example, in this code:

------------------------------------------------------------
with torch.no_grad():
    desired_norm = 1.0  # Target scale
    U_norm = model.U.norm(p='fro')
    if U_norm > 0:
        model.U.mul_(desired_norm / U_norm)
    V_norm = model.V.norm(p='fro')
    if V_norm > 0:
        model.V.mul_(desired_norm / V_norm)
------------------------------------------------------------

if the norm is exactly zero, the condition (U_norm > 0) fails and no scaling is applied. That means if U (or V) becomes exactly zero, the projection doesn't change it—it remains zero.

In practice, it is quite unlikely for parameters to end up exactly zero during training when using gradient-based methods and standard initializations. However, if you want to absolutely ensure that the norm never becomes exactly zero, you might incorporate a safeguard such as adding a small epsilon before dividing. For example:

------------------------------------------------------------
with torch.no_grad():
    desired_norm = 1.0  # Target scale
    eps = 1e-8
    U_norm = model.U.norm(p='fro')
    model.U.mul_(desired_norm / (U_norm + eps))
    V_norm = model.V.norm(p='fro')
    model.V.mul_(desired_norm / (V_norm + eps))
------------------------------------------------------------

In this version, even when U_norm or V_norm is zero, the addition of epsilon prevents a division by zero error and ensures the operation completes. Note that if the weights are exactly zero, multiplying by desired_norm/(eps) could suddenly inflate those parameters. So when using such a safeguard, it's important to monitor the effect on training.

Thus, while the basic projection code doesn't guarantee the weights won't be zero, in typical scenarios it is sufficient, and you can always add extra safeguards if necessary.
