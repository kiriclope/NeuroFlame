*** I am modelling a delayed paired association task with RNNs. The network receives either of two sample inputs A or B and after a delay period either of two test inputs C or D. The networks needs to learn to give a positive readout when A is followed by C and B by D. This can be viewed in a simple toy model as a rotation in a 2D plane (A vs B axis and Response No response axis). In this model, test odors rotate the activity by plus or minus 45°. How can I simply explain that model?

A succinct way to picture the “two‐dimensional rotation” idea is this:

1. First, imagine that the network’s activity in response to the sample (A vs. B) is represented somewhere along a horizontal axis in a 2D plane.
2. The task then requires either a “respond” or “don’t respond” outcome, which can be placed along the vertical axis.
3. When the test stimulus arrives (C or D), it shifts the internal state by a fixed rotation in that plane. In one case (say A followed by C), the rotation points the state into the “respond” quadrant; in the other case (A followed by D), the rotation points the state into the “no‐respond” quadrant.

In other words, each test stimulus nudges the internal representation (which initially distinguishes A vs. B on one axis) by ±45 degrees so that the new direction either lands in a region corresponding to “positive” (respond) or “negative” (don’t respond). You can think of the network learning to rotate its internal state in just the right way so that the correct sample‐test pair combination ends up in the “respond” region, while an incorrect sample‐test pair remains in the “no‐respond” region.

*** What I want to explain is that if you are on either side of the plane (right side encoding A and left side encoding B) then the only way to perform the task (go up for AC and BD and go down for AD and BC) is with a rotation

One way to see why you “must” use a rotation in the 2D plane is simply to check that A and B start on opposite sides (e.g., right vs. left), and the task demands that each of those two starting points must be sent “up” under one test cue (C or D) and “down” under the other. Geometrically, a uniform shift (translation) would push both A and B in the same direction and could never separate them into “up” vs. “down.” Similarly, a reflection or a simple scaling does not solve the problem for both A and B at once. By contrast, a ±45° rotation centered at the origin naturally takes “A on the right” to either “up” or “down” and likewise takes “B on the left” to the opposite choice. Indeed, if you place A at (1, 0) and B at (−1, 0), then rotating by +45° sends A up but sends B down; rotating by −45° does the reverse. Thus, a rotation is the simplest linear transformation that maps (A→up, B→down) or (A→down, B→up) depending on the test cue.

*** I need to make a little schematic to explain it

Below is a simple way to sketch (and label) a 2D schematic showing how a rotation cleanly separates “AC/BD → respond” (up) vs. “AD/BC → no‐respond” (down):

1) Draw a horizontal axis (“Sample identity”) with A on the right and B on the left.
2) Draw a vertical axis (“Response”) with “respond” (↑) on top and “no respond” (↓) at the bottom.
3) Place two points on the horizontal axis, one at ( +1, 0 ) for A and one at ( −1, 0 ) for B:

     respond (↑)
         |
         |
  (B)   --+--   (A)
         |
         |
     no respond (↓)

4) Now show how a +45° “rotation” sends (A) up into “respond” while sending (B) down, or vice versa if the rotation is −45°. Concretely:
   • An arrow from A angled +45° lands in the top half (respond).
   • The same +45° rotation sends B into the bottom half (no respond).

5) Label the +45° arrow as your “C test” (for instance), and the −45° arrow as your “D test,” indicating that the test odor effectively rotates the activity by ±45° and thus splits the plane into the required “up vs. down” outcomes.

Because pure translations would shift both A and B equally (never separating them into up/down) and scalings or reflections also fail to give opposite up/down outputs from opposite sides of the x‐axis, the ±45° rotation is the neat linear transformation that maps:
• A → up (respond) and B → down (no respond) under one test odor, and
• A → down and B → up under the other test odor.

That’s the essence of why “rotation” in a 2D plane is the simplest schematic explanation for this paired association task.

*** What counter arguments could you find against rotations in the activity plane?

Below are some counterarguments or caveats to the idea of a strict rotation in a 2D activity plane:

1. The network might use more complex transformations.
   • Real recurrent networks often work in higher‐dimensional state spaces and can employ nonlinear dynamics. What looks like a neat geometric rotation in 2D could actually be just a 2D projection of more complicated activity patterns.

2. A pure rotation is not the only linear mapping.
   • Other linear transformations (e.g., shear transformations, reflections, or combinations thereof) could accomplish the “map A to ‘up’, B to ‘down’” scheme if you allow for a suitable readout boundary. Rotation is simply one particularly intuitive choice.

3. Translations or shifts could matter in higher‐dimensional state spaces.
   • Even if a purely 2D toy model suggests rotation is the simplest visualization, in a high‐dimensional network it could be a combined shift + rotation + nonlinearity.

4. The network readout need not be purely “up vs. down.”
   • In practice, the network might use a more general decision boundary. A 2D rotation is a nice schematic but not necessarily the literal way real neurons or artificial RNNs implement the mapping.

5. Noise, variability, and heterogeneity in real networks.
   • Actual neural or large RNN activity can be messy—small deviations from a perfect rotation might still solve the task. The clean rotation story is an idealized explanation rather than a strict requirement.
